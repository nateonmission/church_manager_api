# Planning
## Conception
A few years ago, I took another Java class. After successfully completing that course, I, initially, felt pretty good. However, a friend asked me to build a Church Management System (CMS) for his church. I had to tell him that, at that time, I didn't think I had the skills to do that. Having learned so much more, I wanted to take the opportunity to actually begin building that project.
